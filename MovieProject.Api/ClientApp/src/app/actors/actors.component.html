        Acting technique is paramount to anyone wanting to be a serious actor. It's quite easy to imitate a character or
        even an emotion, but where's the depth in that? How can you sustain or repeat again what you might have found
        intuitively? Do you even know what you did or how you did it?
        The technique, however, will help you find a character, which in turn informs how you approach the
        text/script/written word. How do you bring the dialogue alive? How do you know what choices to make? The goal of
        a trained actor is to become a fully realised three-dimensional character, with a rich backstory. I must believe
        the character you play is truthful and not a cliche, a caricature, a thin external representation of someone who
        barely resembles a human being. I must believe what you say is real and that you're not reciting, spouting or
        commenting.
