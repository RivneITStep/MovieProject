      <p class="movies-header">A film, also called a movie, motion picture or moving picture, is a work of visual art
        used
        to simulate experiences that communicate ideas, stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty, or atmosphere through
        the
        use of moving images. These images are generally accompanied by sound, and more rarely, other sensory
        stimulations.[1] The word "cinema", short for cinematography, is often used to refer to filmmaking and the film
        industry, and to the art form that is the result of it.

        The moving images of a film are created by photographing actual scenes with a motion-picture camera, by
        photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques, by means of CGI and computer
        animation, or by a combination of some or all of these techniques, and other visual effects.

        Traditionally, films were recorded onto celluloid film stock through a photochemical process and then shown
        through a movie projector onto a large screen. Contemporary films are often fully digital through the entire
        process of production, distribution, and exhibition, while films recorded in a photochemical form traditionally
        included an analogous optical soundtrack (a graphic recording of the spoken words, music and other sounds that
        accompany the images which runs along a portion of the film exclusively reserved for it, and is not projected).
